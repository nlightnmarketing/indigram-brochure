                <h3 class="service-title"><span class="icon">⚡</span>Sales Agent | Converting Website Visitors to Customers</h3>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Problem ></strong> Agri-tech businesses selling specialized equipment—solar panels for irrigation, biogas systems, IoT sensors for farm monitoring, or off-grid refrigeration units—lose potential buyers when farmers visiting their websites have technical questions about capacity, installation requirements, financing options, warranty terms, or government subsidy eligibility that go unanswered, resulting in abandoned inquiries and delayed purchase decisions.</p>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Solution ></strong> FRIDAYi Sales Agent engages website visitors in natural language conversations, intelligently accessing product specifications, installation guides, financing schemes, warranty documents, subsidy eligibility criteria, and promotional offers to provide instant, accurate answers. For example, a farmer asking "Will this 5HP solar pump work for my 2-acre field?" receives immediate guidance on pump capacity, installation costs, available EMI options, and applicable subsidies, with seamless handoff to sales representatives for site assessments.</p>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Impact ></strong> 35-50% increase in qualified lead generation, 40% reduction in inquiry-to-quote time, higher conversion rates on technical products requiring detailed explanations, and sales teams freed from repetitive queries to focus on field demonstrations and closing high-value institutional deals with FPOs, cooperatives, and government programs.</p>

            <div class="service">
                <h3 class="service-title"><span class="icon">🛒</span>Ecom Agent | Powering E-Commerce Sales Growth</h3>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Problem ></strong> D2C brands selling farm-fresh products—premium organic pulses, traditional pickles, artisanal dairy, healthy nut mixes, or sustainable tribal products—experience 60-70% cart abandonment when urban customers have questions about product authenticity, sourcing practices, nutritional information, shelf life, bulk discounts for gifting, or delivery timelines. During festival seasons or harvest periods when demand spikes, small support teams cannot handle the query volume, leading to lost sales and frustrated customers.</p>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Solution ></strong> FRIDAYi Ecom Agent serves as a 24/7 shopping assistant on e-commerce platforms, answering questions by accessing product catalogs, certification documents, sourcing stories, nutritional data, and pricing policies. For instance, when a customer asks "Are these cashews really pesticide-free?" the agent shares certification details, farm sourcing information, and processing methods. It handles bulk order inquiries, suggests gift bundles, explains subscription benefits, processes coupon codes, and recovers abandoned carts by sending personalized WhatsApp or SMS reminders with relevant product information.</p>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Impact ></strong> 25-40% reduction in cart abandonment, 3x increase in customer support capacity during peak seasons without hiring additional staff, 20-30% growth in average order value through intelligent upselling and bundle suggestions, improved customer retention through instant query resolution, and enhanced brand trust as customers receive detailed, transparent information about product origins and quality.</p>

            <div class="service">
                <h3 class="service-title"><span class="icon">📡</span>Info Agent | Enhancing Information Access for Portals</h3>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Problem ></strong> Agricultural market intelligence platforms, precision farming portals, and agri-news websites containing critical data—commodity prices across 20+ mandis, weather forecasts, IoT sensor analytics, crop advisory reports, and government scheme updates—see high bounce rates because farmers and agri-businesses struggle to quickly locate specific information relevant to their crops, regions, or needs. A farmer needing "current onion prices in Nashik APMC" or "NPK recommendations for wheat in Punjab" wastes valuable time navigating complex menus and search functions, often leaving frustrated without finding the data they urgently need for time-sensitive decisions.</p>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Solution ></strong> FRIDAYi Info Agent acts as an intelligent guide on information portals, engaging users in conversational queries to understand their specific needs and instantly surfacing relevant data from extensive databases, market reports, technical documents, and news archives. A farmer can simply ask "What's the potato price trend in UP this week?" and receive current prices, weekly comparisons, and related market insights. The agent processes complex datasets, PDFs, agronomic reports, and scheme documents to deliver personalized, contextualized information, and can escalate advanced technical queries to agronomists or support teams.</p>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Impact ></strong> 50-70% improvement in information discovery time, 3-4x increase in daily active users and session duration, higher subscription retention as users find consistent value, reduced support tickets for "how to find X" queries, and strengthened platform reputation as the go-to resource for reliable, accessible agricultural intelligence—positioning the platform as indispensable for farming decisions and expanding opportunities for premium data services and advertising partnerships.</p>

                <h3 class="service-title"><span class="icon">🤝</span>Internal Company Bots | HR Bot for Policy Assistance</h3>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Problem ></strong> Fast-growing agri startups scaling from 50 to 200+ employees across field operations, procurement centers, and headquarters face mounting HR bottlenecks. Field staff in remote locations repeatedly ask about leave eligibility during harvest seasons, medical insurance coverage for family members, travel reimbursement procedures, maternity benefits, transfer policies when opening new regional offices, social media guidelines when sharing company achievements, and sexual harassment reporting protocols. With 2-3 HR personnel handling queries from multiple states, response times stretch to 2-3 days, frustrating employees and creating compliance risks as critical policies remain unclear.</p>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Solution ></strong> FRIDAYi company bot platform ingests HR policy documents, employee handbooks, and compliance guidelines to create intelligent AI assistants. The HR Bot, trained on comprehensive policy documentation—including medical benefits and insurance coverage, leave policies (casual, sick, maternity, paternity), transfer and relocation procedures, code of conduct and ethics policies, social media usage guidelines, sexual harassment prevention and POSH compliance, travel and expense policies—provides instant, accurate, personalized responses via Slack, Teams, or WhatsApp. An employee can ask "How many paternity leave days am I eligible for?" or "What's covered under my health insurance?" and receive immediate, policy-accurate answers with relevant document excerpts. Complex cases requiring HR judgment are seamlessly escalated to the HR team with full context.</p>
                <p class="service-desc"><strong>Impact ></strong> 60-75% reduction in routine HR query volume, response time dropping from 2-3 days to under 1 minute for standard queries, improved policy compliance as employees access clear information 24/7, enhanced employee satisfaction scores particularly among geographically distributed teams, and HR teams freed from repetitive queries to focus on strategic priorities—talent acquisition for rapid expansion, leadership development programs, performance management systems, and building strong organizational culture critical for retaining talent in competitive agri-tech space.</p>
